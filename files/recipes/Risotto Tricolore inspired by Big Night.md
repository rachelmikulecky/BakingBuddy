## Directions

Pressure Cooker Method:
1. Add 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the bowl of a pressure cooker. Turn the pressure cooker on high to melt the butter.
2. Once the pot is heated and the butter is melted, add the chopped onion. Cook the onions until they are translucent and tender, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Add the crushed garlic and cook until the garlic is fragrant about 30 seconds
4. Add the Arborio rice and saute until the edges of the rice become translucent about 3 minutes.
5. Add the white wine and stock. Secure the lid of the pressure cooker and cook under high pressure for 4 minutes.
6. Manually release the steam from the pressure cooker valve.
7. Remove the lid and stir vigorously until the risotto comes together.
8. Add the Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1 tablespoon butter.
9. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and then serve immediately.

Stovetop Method:
1. In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent and tender, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4. Add the Arborio rice and saute until the edges of the rice become translucent about 3 minutes.
5. Add the white wine and cook until the liquid is mostly evaporated.
6. Add the heated stock one large ladle-full at a time. Most of the liquid should be evaporated before adding another ladle of stock. Make sure to keep the risotto at a simmer and to stir consistently during the cooking process.
7. After about 15-20 minutes, the risotto should be al dente and all of the stock incorporated.
8. Turn off the heat, and add the Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1 tablespoon butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper, serve immediately.

Note:
1. To make Seafood Risotto, swap the chicken stock for homemade seafood stock (recipe listed below), and substitute 3 tablespoons lobster butter (recipe listed below) in place of the 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter.
2. To make Pesto Risotto, swap the chicken stock for homemade vegetable stock, and add ½ cup basil pesto (recipe listed below) to finish.

Seafood Stock Method:
1. On a large rimmed baking sheet, add prawn shells and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
2. Roast the shells at 375 °F for 10 minutes or until red.
3. In a large pot, heat another tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add carrots, onion, and celery and cook until lightly browned about 5 minutes.
4. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
5. Deglaze the pot with the white wine and stir to combine.
6. Add the water, roasted prawn shells, parsley, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves.
7. Simmer the stock for 45 minutes. Use immediately, or chill the stock over an ice bath and refrigerate until ready to use.

Lobster Butter Method:
1. Steam the lobster tails and allow the tails to cool slightly before handling them.
2. Remove the lobster meat from the shells (reserve) and devein tails.
3. Roughly chop the lobster meat and then, place it in a food processor. Process the meat until pureed and reserve.
4. Over a double-boiler, melt the butter.
5. Finely chop the reserved lobster shells. Add the shells to the melted butter and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
6. Removed the butter from the heat and strain through a double layer of cheesecloth or a clean dishtowel. (Be careful as this mixture will be hot and sharp from the shells.)
7. Chill the butter over an ice bath and add the reserved chopped lobster meat.
8. Stir to combine and reserve in the fridge until ready to use.

Basil Pesto Method:
1. Combine basil leaves, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and about ½ of the extra virgin olive oil in the base of a food processor. Process the pesto until well combined and homogenous.
2. Slowly add the remaining olive oil until the mixture becomes fluid but not overly liquidy.
3. Reserve the pesto in an airtight container until ready to use.
